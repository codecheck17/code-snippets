## 💡 How I Work
- Prefer small, incremental changes and frequent reviews
- Write tests for important logic and aim for maintainable abstractions
- Document intent, not just implementation — README and examples first
- Use automation (linting, CI) to keep the codebase healthy

## 📈 GitHub & Community
- Open-source contributor interested in helpful, well-scoped issues
- Active in developer communities and code review

You can optionally add a GitHub stats card and top languages graph here:
